This program was written as an assignment of the Advanced Data Structures in Java course offered by __UC San Diego through Coursera as the third course of 5 parts courses of _Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond Specialization___ where the skeleton as well as some starter code had been provided.

## I've learnt from this course as follows:
1. Graph abstract data type (ADT)
1. Interpret graph structure and properties from different graph representations.
1. Write classes in Java to implement graphs
1. Create graphs in Java using an adjacency matrix representation and an adjacency list representation
1. Java Class Design, Redesign and Refactoring
1. Critique aspects of code design
1. Finding shortest paths in weighted graphs
1. Route planning and NP-hard graph problems

__To find a shortest route in Google map where I've implemented the following algorithms:__
1. Breadth First Search
1. Dijkstra Search
1. A* Search

 #### Work example:
 1. Loading local (Near Saint Petersruurg Polytechnical university) intersections in the map: ![](/img/Intersections.png)
 
 1. Rout between two location: ![](/img/route.png)
 
 1. Breadth First Search (BFS) Result for the above mentioned route:
   1. Total nodes visit to find the shortest rout: ![](/img/bfs_route_number.png)
   
   1. BFS search visiualization: ![](/img/bfs_visualization.png)
   
 1. Dijkstra Result for the above mentioned route:
   1. Total nodes visit to find the shortest rout: ![](/img/dijkstra _route_number.png)
   
   1. Dijkstra visiualization: ![](/img/dijkstra_visualization.png)
   
 1. A* Search (BFS) Result for the above mentioned route:
   1. Total nodes visit to find the shortest rout: ![](/img/astart_route_number.png)
   
   1. A* search visiualization: ![](/img/astarvisualization.png)
